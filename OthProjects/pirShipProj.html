                <p>This was an incredibly fun project. It definitly had it's challenges. I started the project with a 
                    CAD drawing using SketchUp. I am not a great drawer so I need to design everything on the computer
                    to really wrap my head around the whole project and visually see how everything is going to come 
                    together. I knew this was going to be an expensive project as well. I thought about other ways to
                    build a boat looking object. But I really liked the idea of being able to walk onto the boat and into 
                    the back of the truck. So I needed to build it out of wood. (Don't ask how much it was, the answer is probably to much, lol)
                    From there, it was several trips to Home Depot. Getting wood, screws, tools and whatever was needed. I wanted to
                    incorporate some fun stuff to do on the ship as well. So I knew I wanted a ships wheel as well as a bubble 
                    blowing cannon. After about a month of building, I had finally finished the boat. Trunk-or-treat was Sunday
                    night, and I had just finished the boat Sunday afternoon. Loading the boat to go to the church was 
                    definitly interesting. But after some struggling, it was all loaded up and ready to go. Got there with plenty of
                    time to set up. Put the ship together and then set up the wiring for power. I had a 12v lawn mower battery
                    hooked up to a power inverter to get power to the lights and the bubble blower. It lasted the whole hour and a half
                    to two hours. I was certatinly impressed. The time came, kids showed up and it was a lot of fun. I am very glad I 
                    did this project and could spread some joy, happiness and God's love to kids and those around me. Check out some of the pictures
                    below.
