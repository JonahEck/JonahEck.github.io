							<p id="project_p">Status: Abandoned</p>
							<p id="project_p">Description:</p>
							<p id="project_p">So the issue I have, my room it cramped as it is. I wanted more desk space so my idea was to build a bunk bed with a 
								desk underneath. The issue is, my ceiling is not high enough so give me adequate head either sitting at the desk or sitting in the bed.
								My solution was to engineer a bunk bed that lifts and lowers the bed by about a foot. This would give me enough head room sitting at my 
								desk when raised, and then enough room in my bed when lowered. I had decided to abandon the project since the price of wood is insane as well
								as I just was not sure everything would work out the way I wanted. But I am proud of my design as well as I had purchsed the linear motors to
								lift the bed and was doing some testing with them. I learned quite a bit doing this project with eletronics as well as some python coding on 
								a raspberry pi. Click the link below to check out more on this project.

					<p id="project_p">Arg! Who doesn't want there own pirate ship. So my church was having a trunk-or-treat for halloween this year. I knew I wanted
						to try to do something with my truck. I had the idea of making a pirate to go around my truck. It would let people walk up into 
						the boat and the bed of the truck. It turned out to be a challenge, but I challenge that I concurred. I think the final product came out perfect.
